# R codes for model fitting

`gridParams_TmeanB.R`: It creates the initial set of parameters

`poObject_TmeanB.R`: It creates the object of class pomp (see [link](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/vignettes/getting_started.html) for details on how to use pomp)

`mifSearch1_TmeanB.R`: The initial search of parameter space was performed using the grid generated by `poObject_TmeanB.R`. The output of this search is then used as the initial conditions of a more local search. 

`mifRefine1_TmeanB.R`: It repeats the search of parameter space using the output of `mifSearch1_TmeanB.R` until the maximum likelihood value was stationary. 

`mifProf_rho.R`: This code is an example of a profile Likelihood estimation.

`figure2_fitting.R`: It simulates the trajectory with the maximum likelihood estimate and compares it with the observed data.
